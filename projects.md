## **Course Projects**
1. **Autoencoder Architectures for Image Colorization and Noise Reduction**  
   [_DS303, Introduction to Machine Learning_](https://www.minds.iitb.ac.in/index.php/academics/minor-ai-ds?id=22), [_Prof. Biplab Banerjee_](https://biplab-banerjee.github.io/)  
 ![Autoencoder Noise Reduction](images/autoencoders.png){:width="700px"}    
  In a simple Autoencoder, there are three subparts - an encoder, encoded vector and a decoder. These highly versatile frameworks learn important features of data when trained accordingly. These are vastly used for image colorisation and noise reduction. We have tried to explain some of the characteristics through working models, and contrast them with conventional counterparts. 

2. **Machine Learning for COVID-19 Data Analysis**  
  [_DS203, Programming for Data Science_](https://www.minds.iitb.ac.in/index.php/academics/minor-ai-ds/2-uncategorised/20-ds-203), [_Prof. Amit Sethi_](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~asethi/), [_Prof. Manjesh Hanawal_](https://www.ieor.iitb.ac.in/files/faculty/mhanawal/index.html)    
  The advent of machine learning and its wide applications ameliorated the Covid-19 pandemic to a respectable extent. We try to address some of the basic questions and draw important conclusions from the official WHO data of Covid-19. In the other part, we try to build a model for predicting the requirement of ICU admission of any patient based on blood and body parameters.  
 

3. **IITB-RISC Microprocessor Design**      
  [_EE309, Microprocessors_](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/academics/courses/EE309), [_Prof. Virendra Singh_](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~viren/)  
 Microprocessors are an indispensible part of today's world. In this project, we built a Turing complete 17 instruction ISA in VHDL. We used an 8-register 16-bit RISC microprocessor design. Incorporated _Multicycle_ and _Pipeline_ based architectures in our design. 

## **Other Projects**
1.**Visualising Deep Neural Networks**
  _Winter in Data Science | Analytics Club_
 * Explored Attribution Approach for interpreting Deep Neural Networks, with a qualitative focus on image recognition neural architectures, by acquiring ground truth labels and studying the model activation maps
 * Studied the applications of Class Activation Maps, Occlusion Sensitivity Maps and Saliency Maps to visualise CNN functioning for intuitive understanding of various image classification and detection algorithms
