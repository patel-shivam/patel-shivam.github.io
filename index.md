_Welcome to my homepage._     

Hi there, I'm Shivam, a first-year PhD student in the Department of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.cmu.edu), [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu).      


I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Gauri Joshi](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/gaurij/).         


                  
I have previously worked with Prof. Vivek Borkar for my Bachelors Thesis Project. My initial thesis work on Asymptotic Risk Measures for Markov Chains was presented at _IEEE SPCOM 2024_. Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13513). I later worked on an optimal control formulation of the reverse denoising process in generative modelling.       

I spent the last summer at the beautiful [USC](https://www.usc.edu) [Viterbi School of Engineering](https://viterbischool.usc.edu) working with [Prof. Meisam Razaviyayn](https://sites.usc.edu/razaviyayn/) on fair ML. My research was supported by the [IUSSTF-Viterbi](https://iusstf.org/iusstf-viterbi-program) research grant by the Government of India. Our work "f-FERM: A Scalable Framework for Robust Fair Empirical Risk Minimization" will appear at The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations ([ICLR 2024](https://iclr.cc)). An initial version was presented at the 15th [OPT-ML Workshop](https://opt-ml.org), [NeurIPS 2023](https://neurips.cc). Please read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03259).  
 

Some relatively non-academic things about me - 
* I am an avid birdwatcher, and spend most of my winter Sunday mornings at the nature park with a pair of binoculars and the Helm Field Guide.
* I also play tabla and harmonium occasionally.
* Quite a philosopher myself. Speak 4 languages.
