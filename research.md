<h2><b>Research Projects</b></h2>
-----------------------------------------

1. **An Asymptotic CVaR Measure of Risk for Markov Chains**            
   Bachelor Thesis, Advisor: Prof. Vivek Borkar, [IIT Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in)     
   My first Bachelor Thesis Project is under review at IEEE SPCOM 2024.     

2. **Optimization for Fairness Applications**   
  Research Internship, Advisor: [Prof. Meisam Razaviyayn](https://sites.usc.edu/razaviyayn/), [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu)    
  Our work "f-FERM: A Scalable Framework for Robust Fair Empirical Risk Minimization" will appear at The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations ([**ICLR 2024**](https://iclr.cc)). An initial version was presented at the 15th [**OPT-ML Workshop**](https://opt-ml.org), [**NeurIPS 2023**](https://neurips.cc). Please read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03259).    


4. **Electronic Tilt Estimation using Neural Networks for Cell Tower Antennas**

  Wireless communication has been made a commercially feasible option through large-scale development of cell tower grids. Optimizing antennas used in cell towers is  indispensable for improving wireless communication. With large-scale deployment and utilisation, it is essential to plan resource allocation and directional specifications of antennas for maximum utility. This summer research project was based on optimizing the electronic tilt of cell tower antennas.

5. **Time Series Anomaly Detection**  
  RnD Project | [Prof. Nikhil Karamchandani](https://sites.google.com/site/nikhilkaram/) | [Applied Materials](https://www.appliedmaterials.com/)

   ![Anomaly Detection in Sinusoidal Data](/images/tsad-images/prediction_sin.png){: width="750" }  
   I worked with Prof. Nikhil Karamchandani on Anomaly Detection in Semi-Periodic Data with unidirectional Anomalies. We used the predictor-discriminator setting for anomaly detection, where a predictor model predicts an upcoming datapoint, and discriminator model determines if the observed datapoint is an anomaly based on difference between actual and predicted values. I implemented the accumulator and Gaussian tail discriminators, and the Fourier, LSTM, Bidirectional RNN predictors.   
  
6. **Stochastic Climate Modelling**   
  Research Internship, [Prof. Sandeep Juneja](https://www.tcs.tifr.res.in/~sandeepj/), [TIFR](https://www.tifr.res.in/)

  Climate modelling lies at the intersection of physics, mathematics and machine learning. Various generations of climate prediction models are widely being used in practice today. Our work was focused on the modelling of Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall, and finding optimal models for the same. There are three ways of approaching rainfall prediction - Statistical, Empirical and Dynamic. Our research was concerned with 'physics-free' statistical methods, which use other weather indicators to predict rainfall in India. We also studied IPCC reports and explored the latest CMIP models for climate prediction, and it's applicability to our setting. Currently, we are working on ultra-short time scale (2-16 hrs) prediction, called 'nowcasting'.

7. **Navigation Using SNNs** (Reading Project)
  Summer Undergraduate Research Program , [Prof. Udayan Ganguly](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/people/udayan-ganguly/)    
    ![SNN Block Diagram](/images/navigation-using-snn/snn-block.png){: width="350" }

  Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are electronic emulations of biological neurons. Biomimicry of the relatively simple nervous system of _C. Elegans_ gives us a good insight into how information can be utilised efficiently in relatively sparse systems and energy constrained environments. Our project was based on emulating the _C. Elegans_ worm navigation using simplified binary neurons, wherein information is encoded through voltage spikes in neurons. Various navigation and foraging algorithms were studied, and emulated in software. The results were qualitatively and quantitatively found to closely follow the actual navigation of the worm in varying concentration 2D environments.
