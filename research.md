  Wireless communication has been made a commercially feasible option through large scale developement of cell tower grids. Optimizing antennas used in cell towers is  indispensible for improving wireless communication. With largescale deployment and utilisation, it is essential to plan resource allocation and directional specifications of antennas for maximum utility. This summer project was based on optimizing the electronic tilt of cell tower antennas.

2. **Time Series Anomaly Detection**  
  RnD Project | [Prof. Nikhil Karamchandani](https://sites.google.com/site/nikhilkaram/) | [Applied Materials](https://www.appliedmaterials.com/)  
   ![Anomaly Detection in Random Data](/images/tsad-images/prediction-lite.png){: width="600" }   
  This is an ongoing research project under Prof. Nikhil Karamchandani, sponsored by Applied Materials India ltd. We are currently working on designing robust anomaly detection algorithms. Use case requirements for different metrics like precision-recall tradeoff, lookback-data size, unreliability of seasonal trends etc. need to be taken into account. Time Series Anomaly Detection has in itself an ML model trying to forecast the upcoming value, and a discriminator algorithm that classifies the actual obtained datapoint as anomalous or otherwise depending on difference between the forecasted and received values. 
  
3. **Stochastic Climate Modelling**   
  Research Internship, [Prof. Sandeep Juneja](https://www.tcs.tifr.res.in/~sandeepj/), [TIFR](https://www.tifr.res.in/)     
  
4. **Navigation Using SNNs**  
  Summer Undergraduate Research Program , [Prof. Udayan Ganguly](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/people/udayan-ganguly/)
