1. **Electronic Tilt Estimation using Neural Networks for Cell Tower Antennas**

  Wireless communication has been made a commercially feasible option through large scale developement of cell tower grids. Optimizing antennas used in cell towers is  indispensible for improving wireless communication. With largescale deployment and utilisation, it is essential to plan resource allocation and directional specifications of antennas for maximum utility. This summer project was based on optimizing the electronic tilt of cell tower antennas.

2. **Time Series Anomaly Detection**  
  RnD Project | [Prof. Nikhil Karamchandani](https://sites.google.com/site/nikhilkaram/) | [Applied Materials](https://www.appliedmaterials.com/)  
   ![Anomaly Detection in Random Data](/images/tsad-images/prediction-lite.png){: width="600" }   
  This is an ongoing research project under Prof. Nikhil Karamchandani, sponsored by Applied Materials India ltd. We are currently working on designing robust anomaly detection algorithms. Use case requirements for different metrics like precision-recall tradeoff, lookback-data size, unreliability of seasonal trends etc. need to be taken into account. Time Series Anomaly Detection has in itself an ML model trying to forecast the upcoming value, and a discriminator algorithm that classifies the actual obtained datapoint as anomalous or otherwise depending on difference between the forecasted and received values. 
  
3. **Stochastic Climate Modelling**   
  Research Internship, [Prof. Sandeep Juneja](https://www.tcs.tifr.res.in/~sandeepj/), [TIFR](https://www.tifr.res.in/)

  Climate modelling lies at the intersection of physics, mathematics and machine learning. Various generations of climate prediction models are widely being used in practice today. Our work was focused on the modelling of Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall, and finding optimal models for the same. There are three ways of approaching rainfall prediction - Statistical, Empirical and Dynamic. Our research was concerned with 'physics-free' statistical methods, which use other weather indicators to predict rainfall in India. We also studied IPCC reports and explored the latest CMIP models for climate prediction, and it's applicability to our setting. Currently, we are working on ultra-short time scale (2-16 hrs) prediction, called 'nowcasting'.
