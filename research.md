  In a simple Autoencoder, there are three subparts - an encoder, encoded vector and a decoder. These highly versatile frameworks learn important features of data when trained accordingly. These are vastly used for image colorisation and noise reduction. We have tried to explain some of the characteristics through working models, and contrast them with conventional counterparts.
