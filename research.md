<h2><b>Research Projects</b></h2>
-----------------------------------------

1. **Rare Event Simulation for Risk Measures on Markov Processes**            
   Bachelor Thesis, Advisor: [Prof. Vivek Borkar](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=Km1V8WwAAAAJ&hl=en), [IIT Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in)     
   Ongoing Work...   

2. **Optimization for Fairness Applications**   
  Research Internship, Advisor: [Prof. Meisam Razaviyayn](https://sites.usc.edu/razaviyayn/), [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu)  
  Ongoing Work...  


4. **Electronic Tilt Estimation using Neural Networks for Cell Tower Antennas**            
   Artificial Intelligence Intern, [Reliance Industries Ltd.](https://www.ril.com/)

  Wireless communication has been made a commercially feasible option through large scale developement of cell tower grids. Optimizing antennas used in cell towers is  indispensible for improving wireless communication. With largescale deployment and utilisation, it is essential to plan resource allocation and directional specifications of antennas for maximum utility. This summer project was based on optimizing the electronic tilt of cell tower antennas.

5. **Time Series Anomaly Detection**  
  RnD Project | [Prof. Nikhil Karamchandani](https://sites.google.com/site/nikhilkaram/) | [Applied Materials](https://www.appliedmaterials.com/)  
   ![Anomaly Detection in Random Data](/images/tsad-images/prediction-lite.png){: width="750" }  
   ![Anomaly Detection in Sinusoidal Data](/images/tsad-images/prediction_sin.png){: width="750" }  
  This is an ongoing research project under Prof. Nikhil Karamchandani. We are currently working on designing robust anomaly detection algorithms. Use case requirements for different metrics like precision-recall tradeoff, lookback-data size, unreliability of seasonal trends etc. need to be taken into account. Time Series Anomaly Detection has in itself an ML model trying to forecast the upcoming value, and a discriminator algorithm that classifies the actual obtained datapoint as anomalous or otherwise depending on difference between the forecasted and received values. 
  
6. **Stochastic Climate Modelling**   
  Research Internship, [Prof. Sandeep Juneja](https://www.tcs.tifr.res.in/~sandeepj/), [TIFR](https://www.tifr.res.in/)

  Climate modelling lies at the intersection of physics, mathematics and machine learning. Various generations of climate prediction models are widely being used in practice today. Our work was focused on the modelling of Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall, and finding optimal models for the same. There are three ways of approaching rainfall prediction - Statistical, Empirical and Dynamic. Our research was concerned with 'physics-free' statistical methods, which use other weather indicators to predict rainfall in India. We also studied IPCC reports and explored the latest CMIP models for climate prediction, and it's applicability to our setting. Currently, we are working on ultra-short time scale (2-16 hrs) prediction, called 'nowcasting'.

7. **Navigation Using SNNs** (Reading Project)
  Summer Undergraduate Research Program , [Prof. Udayan Ganguly](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/people/udayan-ganguly/)    
    ![SNN Block Diagram](/images/navigation-using-snn/snn-block.png){: width="350" }
![Software Worm Trajectory](/images/navigation-using-snn/software-worm-trajectory.png){: width="350" }    
  Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are electronic emulations of biological neurons. Biomimicry of the relatively simple nervous system of _C. Elegans_ gives us a good insight into how information can be utilised efficiently in relatively sparse systems and energy constrained environments. Our project was based on emulating the _C. Elegans_ worm navigation using simplified binary neurons, wherein information is encoded through voltage spikes in neurons. Various navigation and foraging algorithms were studied, and emulated in software. The results were qualitatively and quantitatively found to closely follow the actual navigation of the worm in varying concentration 2D environments.
