 **Abstract**
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The goal of this study is to examine the various
methods, algorithms and paradigms that we can derive
from neural networks, specifically shallow Artificial Neural
Networks (ANNs), to colorise images and create noise free
image reproductions. This paper focuses on the Autoencoder
architecture, which is usually a shallow hourglass shaped neural
network implementation, with limited number of trainable
parameters. This architecture can prove vital for the above
applications in cases of computational hardware limitations. We
try to examine the effect of higher number of epochs during
training, and at what point is the 'elbow point' attained. We also
try to examine and contrast the performance of Autoencoders
and PCA for noise reduction.
