### **Abstract**
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The goal of this study is to investigate and compare
the variations in COVID-19 cases and deaths in a select group of
countries, in an effort to understand which country was efficient
in controlling the rising virus, and to elaborately analyse the
performance of India in curbing the spike in cases. We used
four regression techniques to predict the number of deaths as
a function of other COVID statistics. The second part of the
paper focuses on analyzing the ICU admission possibility for a
COVID patient, given a certain set of medical parameters. We
have employed five classification algorithms here to accurately
predict whether a patient needs to be admitted to an ICU or
not.
