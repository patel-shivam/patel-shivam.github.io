## **Course Projects**
-----------------------------------------  

1. **Stochastic Optimization in Game Theory**  
   EE736, Stochastic Optimization, [_Prof. Vivek Borkar_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivek_Borkar)  
   Game Theoretic representations in the continuous action spaces are vital for solving real-life optimization problems. Conventional research in the field was focused on finite action space games which are efficient in representing economic models of rationality, modelling climatic conditions and extremities, characterizing international peace treaties etc. But with the advent of computing efficiency and applications of game theory to contemporary fields like machine learning, research is being directed towards continuous space games where players can choose from a countable infinite set of actions.

1. **Reinforcement Learning**  
  [_CS747, Foundations of Intelligent Learning Agents_](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~shivaram/teaching/cs747-a2022/index.html), [_Prof. Shivaram Kalyanakrishnan_](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~shivaram/)

  Intelligent machines are adaptive to their environment, and optimize their decisions for maximizing their rewards in different use cases. Reinforcement learning forms the basis of such learning agents, with it's fundamental origins lying in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Some of the algorithms coded as a part of this course are - regret minimization algorithms (linear and sub-linear), policy planning and evaluation, MDP formulation etc.

2. **Autoencoder Architectures for Image Colorization and Noise Reduction**          
   [_DS303, Introduction to Machine Learning_](https://www.minds.iitb.ac.in/index.php/academics/minor-ai-ds?id=22), [_Prof. Biplab Banerjee_](https://biplab-banerjee.github.io/)  
 ![Autoencoder Noise Reduction](images/autoencoders.png){:width="700px"}        
  In a simple Autoencoder, there are three subparts - an encoder, encoded vector and a decoder. These highly versatile frameworks learn important features of data when trained accordingly. These are vastly used for image colorisation and noise reduction. We have tried to explain some of the characteristics through working models, and contrast them with conventional counterparts.

3. **Machine Learning for COVID-19 Data Analysis**   
  [_DS203, Programming for Data Science_](https://www.minds.iitb.ac.in/index.php/academics/minor-ai-ds/2-uncategorised/20-ds-203), [_Prof. Amit Sethi_](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~asethi/), [_Prof. Manjesh Hanawal_](https://www.ieor.iitb.ac.in/files/faculty/mhanawal/index.html)        
  ![Relative Cases](/images/ds203_images/ds203_relative.png){: width="400" }       
  The advent of machine learning and its wide applications ameliorated the Covid-19 pandemic to a respectable extent. We try to address some of the basic questions and draw important conclusions from the official WHO data of Covid-19. In the other part, we try to build a model for predicting the requirement of ICU admission of any patient based on blood and body parameters.

4. **IITB-RISC Microprocessor Design**      
  [_EE309, Microprocessors_](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/academics/courses/EE309), [_Prof. Virendra Singh_](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~viren/)    
  ![RISC MultiState High Level](/images/risc_microprocessor/risc_high_level_design.png){: width="700" }   
 Microprocessors are an indispensable part of today's world. In this project, we built a Turing complete 17 instruction ISA in VHDL. We used an 8-register 16-bit RISC microprocessor design. Incorporated _Multicycle_ and _Pipeline_ based architectures in our design.

## **Other Projects**
-----------------------------------------  
1. **Visualising Deep Neural Networks**    
  [_Winter in Data Science | Analytics Club_](https://gymkhana.iitb.ac.in/~ugacademics/winter-analytics/)    
  ![Relative Cases](/images/wids_project_images/grad_cam_dog_cat.png){: width="700" }     
 * Explored Attribution Approach for interpreting Deep Neural Networks, with a qualitative focus on image recognition neural architectures, by acquiring ground truth labels and studying the model activation maps
 * Studied the applications of Class Activation Maps, Occlusion Sensitivity Maps and Saliency Maps to visualise CNN functioning for an intuitive understanding of various image classification and detection algorithms
